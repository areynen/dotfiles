About
---
Simple cover art viewer for cmus using SDL2 and SDL2_Image.
Instead of being a script that runs another image viewer, this program uses its own window. This allows it to work well with tiling window managers.

---
Cover images are grabbed from mp3 files using id3v2lib. Compile and install the library:
https://github.com/larsbs/id3v2lib
As of 06/18/19, it has some memory leaks, so you should install the memleak-patch branch of https://github.com/hlgsdx/id3v2lib instead.
   It can be cloned with the command:
   git clone --single-branch --branch memleak-patch "https://github.com/hlgsdx/id3v2lib"
If you don't need this feature, you can disable it by editing the makefile. There are instructions located in it.

Compiling
---
`make`
You may want to edit config.h. It'll be copied from config.def.h the first time you run `make.`
If cmus-remote isn't in /usr/bin/cmus-remote, you must open `config.h` and modify the `programArgs` array.

Tip
---
To force the program to check for song change, send SIGUSR1 to the program.
`pkill -USR1 cmusCoverViewer`
To make this automatically run when cmus updates, create a script with the command and tell cmus to use it with 
`:set status_display_program=/home/user/whateverscript.sh`
